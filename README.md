This mini-project report compares two algorithms for finding the maximum and
minimum elements in an array: linear search and divide and conquer. The report
discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm and compares their time
complexity. The implementation of both algorithms is described in detail, and the
performance of each algorithm is evaluated through experimental analysis. The results
show that the divide and conquer algorithm performs better than the linear search
algorithm for larger arrays, while the linear search algorithm is more efficient for
smaller arrays. Overall, this report provides valuable insights into the trade-offs
